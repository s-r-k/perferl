PERFERL README

Prerequisites:
* Erlang/OTP is installed with the default libraries
* Environment variable ERL_HOME is set to the directory where erlang is installed

Procedure:

Modify the perferl_start.sh script and update the paths and hostname as required.(yet to be parameterized)
Run the script perferl_start.sh - It starts yaws web server in embedded mode on the specified port.

By default it is configured to run example_tests/web_requests.perferl which just hits a couple of websites.

open the url : http://<host>:<port>/perferl/perferl/home

enter the number of users to simulate and the ramp up time in seconds and hit start to start the tests.

the results are written to an mnesia database.

run the script perferl_stop.sh to kill perferl.

While perferl is started, erlang shells can be started in perferl/src/ebin directory and refresh the page.
Perferl will pick up all the available nodes and distribute its load evenly.


Notes:
*The erlyweb binaries and yaws binaries are bundled along with the code to ease setting it up.
*The code might have references to hardcoded paths as it is still work in progress.
